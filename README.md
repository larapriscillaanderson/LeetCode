# Programming Progress Journal

Tracking evolution, intellect, and the architecture of mastery.

ðŸ“… Started: January 1, 2025...

My name is Lara Priscilla Anderson, and this journal began as a New Yearâ€™s resolution: solve LeetCode problems daily until I landed a software engineering job. 
What started as a disciplined grind quickly became something moreâ€”an archive of effort, evolution, and self-directed learning.

Early on, I was determined to commit every single day. But as I matured in my approach, I realized that even top performersâ€”engineers, founders, visionariesâ€”take breaks to restructure, reflect, and re-energize. So I did the same. This journal now reflects that philosophy: consistency, yes, but with intention and grace.

As I continued to grow, this repo evolved from a LeetCode diary into a Programming Progress Journal, documenting my deepening knowledge of algorithms, system design, cloud platforms, and more. It's no longer just about solving problemsâ€”it's about becoming the kind of developer who builds meaningful, resilient, and beautiful things.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

To make this progress public, accessible, and useful for othersâ€”especially those who thrive in structured environments and share a love for intellectual exploration. Whether you're a student, a career switcher, or a fellow tech nerd seeking momentum, I hope this journal offers clarity and companionship along your journey.

ðŸ§  Topics Covered:

LeetCode Algorithms (Beginner to Advanced)
Time & Space Complexity Notes
Data Structures & Patterns
Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
Clean Coding Practices
Technical Notes from My Learning Sprints

ðŸ“Œ Reminder:

This is a work-in-progress, just like me. Some entries are polished; others are raw. But all of them are real. And thatâ€™s the point.
