# Programming Progress Journal

🚀 Tracking evolution, 🛸 intellect, and the architecture of mastery 🌊 during my time on Spaceship Earth 🌎.

📅 Started: January 1, 2025... 🧿

My name is Lara Priscilla Anderson, and this journal began as a New Year’s resolution: solve LeetCode problems daily until I landed a software engineering job. 
What started as a disciplined grind quickly became something more... an archive of effort, evolution, and self-directed learning.

Early on, I was determined to commit every single day. But as I matured in my approach, I realized that even top performers—engineers, founders, visionaries—take breaks to restructure, reflect, and re-energize. So I did the same. This journal now reflects that philosophy: consistency, yes, but with intention and grace.

As I continued to grow, this repo evolved from a LeetCode diary into a Programming Progress Journal, documenting my deepening knowledge of algorithms, system design, cloud platforms, and more. It's no longer just about solving problems, it's about becoming the kind of developer who builds meaningful, resilient, and beautiful things.

🎯 Purpose:

To make this progress public, accessible, and useful for others, especially those who thrive in structured environments and share a love for intellectual exploration. Whether you're a student, a career switcher, or a fellow tech nerd seeking momentum, I hope this journal offers clarity and companionship along your journey.

🧠 Topics Covered:

- LeetCode Algorithms (Beginner to Advanced)
- Time & Space Complexity Notes
- Data Structures & Patterns
- Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Sharpening Coding Practices, Monitoring Individual Development, Creating Structured Learning Environments
- Technical Notes from My Learning Sprints

📌 Reminder:

This is a work-in-progress, just like me. Some entries are polished; others are raw. But all of them are real. And that’s the point... ⚛️
