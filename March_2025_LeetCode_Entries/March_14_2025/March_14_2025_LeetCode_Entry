LeetCode Problem: Truncate Sentence
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/truncate-sentence/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. 
Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
You are given a sentence s​​​​​​ and an integer k​​​​​​. 
You want to truncate s​​​​​​ such that it contains only the first k​​​​​​ words. 
Return s​​​​​​ after truncating it.

- initial thoughts: need to return the first k words from the sentence
- could use an approach to split the sentence into a list of words
- then have to join the first k words back into a string
- this can be done using the built in functions .split() and .join()
- the extraction of k words can be done using slicing
- edge cases to consider can include if the string is empty, just return an empty string
- if k is equal to the number of words in the string, just return the sentence
- if k is larger than the number of words, just return the sentence

Time Complexity:

- The .split() and .join() operations iterate through the words once.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
