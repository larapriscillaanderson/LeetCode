LeetCode Problem: Length of Last Word
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

- initial thoughts: have to differentiate between the words and spaces
- need to identify a word as a sequence of non-space characters
- consider that there might be trailing spaces in the string, so the last word
may not be right at the end
- key ideas: using .split() will break the string into words based on spaces
- the .split() built in automatically handles multiple spaces, so it can clean up extra spaces
- the last word's length can simply be derived using the len() function
- access to the last word can be given by accessing its index, words[-1]
