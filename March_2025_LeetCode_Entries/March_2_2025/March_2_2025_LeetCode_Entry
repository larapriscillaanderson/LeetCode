LeetCode Problem: Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-of-all-vowels-in-order/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: A string is considered beautiful if it satisfies the following conditions:

Each of the 5 English vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') must appear at least once in it.
The letters must be sorted in alphabetical order (i.e. all 'a's before 'e's, all 'e's 
before 'i's, etc.).
For example, strings "aeiou" and "aaaaaaeiiiioou" are considered beautiful, 
but "uaeio", "aeoiu", and "aaaeeeooo" are not beautiful.

Given a string word consisting of English vowels, return the length of the longest beautiful substring of word. If no such substring exists, return 0.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

- initial thoughts: must contain all 5 vowels, must be in sorted order,
thus a sliding window approach should be ideal
- the substring should have at least one 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'
- the characters must be increasing in order, 'a' before 'e' etc
- since the goal is to find the longest contiguous valid segment,
a two-pointer sliding window approach makes sense
- one pointer start could represent the beginning of the window
- another pointer end could expand the window
- to track the unique vowels in the window, use a set to ensure
all 5 vowels appear at least once
- there needs to be a reset upon violation, so if the order breaks,
'i' appears after 'o' but before 'e', reset and start fresh
- whenever there is a valid window (all vowels are present and in order),
update the maximum length

Time Complexity:

- The outer loop iterates over each character in word, which is O(n).
- Checking conditions and updating the set within the loop takes O(1) per iteration.
- The worst-case scenario involves iterating through all n characters while maintaining
a constant-sized vowel set.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n) since there is a single pass through the string.

Space Complexity:

- Use a constant-sized set to track unique vowels, which will hold at most 5 elements.
- Other variables like start, max_length take O(1) space.
- Summary: The total space complexity is O(1) because only a fixed number of elements
are stored, regardless of input size.
