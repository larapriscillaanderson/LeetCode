LeetCode Problem: Count Number of Nice Subarrays
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an array of integers nums and an integer k. A continuous subarray is called nice if 
there are k odd numbers on it.

Return the number of nice sub-arrays.

- initial thoughts: need to count subarrays with k odd numbers
- the presence of even numbers doesn't affect the count, but it can extend the subarray
- since k can be small compared to the length of the array, a brute force to
check all the subarrays would be too slow
- could use a sliding window approach to count subarrays with two pointers start and end
- end moves through the array to expand the window
- start moves to shrink the window when it reaches k odd numbers

Time Complexity:

- Summary: The time complexity is O(n) because each element is only processed once.
