LeetCode Problem: Reverse String
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

- initial thoughts: given a list of characters, not a string
- must reverse the list in place, so can't use built in functions .reverse() or [::-1]
to create a new list
- key idea: strings are immutable in Python, but lists are mutable, can modify s directly
- initial approach: using two pointers is an efficient to swap elements without extra space
- could use two pointers, one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right)
- swap characters at left and right
- move left forward and right backward until they meet in the middle
