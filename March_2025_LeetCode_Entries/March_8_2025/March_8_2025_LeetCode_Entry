LeetCode Problem: Reverse Only Letters
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-only-letters/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a string s, reverse the string according to the following rules:

All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position.
All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.
Return s after reversing it.

- initial ideas: string can contain both English letters and non-letter characters
- could use the isaplha() built in function to check whether a character is an English letter
- could use a two pointer technique, one at the beginning of the string, and one at the end
- move the two pointers towards each other, swapping letters when both pointers 
point to English letters
- stop when the two pointers cross or meet
