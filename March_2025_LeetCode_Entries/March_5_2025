LeetCode Problem: Minimum Size Subarray Sum
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, 
return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. 
If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

- initial ideas: this can be solved using a variable sliding window approach
- since the goal is to find the minimal length of a subarray, need to adjust
the window dynamically
- use two pointers left and right to define the window
- expand the right pointer to increase the sum until it meets or exceeds the target
- once the sum is valid, shrink the window from the left to minimize the size,
while keeping the sum >= target
- also keeping track of the miniumum length found

** NOTE: this will take more depth and time to learn, will resume tomorrow. **

Solution: see attached .py file (Python 3) ** just pseudocode because will revisit **

Revisit? Yes
