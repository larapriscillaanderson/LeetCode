LeetCode Problem: Max Consecutive Ones
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

- initial thoughts: could iterate through the array, looking for 1s and keeping a count
- if a 0 is encountered, reset the count
- there should be a second count with differentiation
- the max count variable will store the longest streak of 1s found
- the current count variable will keep track of the current streak of 1s 
- if a 1 is found, increment current count
- if a 0 is found, update max count and reset current count to 0
- after the loop, check once more if current count is greater than max count,
to handle if the array ends with 1s
- return max count
