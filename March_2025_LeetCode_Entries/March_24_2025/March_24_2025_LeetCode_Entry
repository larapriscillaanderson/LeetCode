LeetCode Problem: Find the Highest Altitude
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. 
The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and 
i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

- initial thoughts: the biker starts at altitude 0 
- each value in gain tracks how much the altitude changes between points
- to get the altitude at each point, add the gain[i] value to the previous altitude
- if gain = [-5, 1, 5, 0, -7], start at altitude 0
- 0 + (-5) = -5
- -5 + 1 = -4 
- -4 + 5 = 1
- 1 + 0 = 1
- 1 + (-7) = -6
- final list of altitudes = [-5, -4, 1, 1, -6]
- the highest altitude is 1

Time Complexity:

- Only loop through gain once.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n).
