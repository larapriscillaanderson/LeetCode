LeetCode Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

- initial thoughts: need to buy stocks before they sell, no shorting stocks allowed
- must have buying day come before selling day
- goal is to maximize profit, so looking for biggest price jump
- there needs to be an edge case limitation because this question is dealing with money
- if there is no profitable trade, aka if prices only go down, should return 0
instead of a negative profit
- a brute force approach would be a bad idea, because it would involve checking every possible pair
- an optimized approach would be sliding window and two pointer solution
- use a left pointer (l) for buying and right pointer (r) for selling
- as the for loop traverses, update min_price (lowest buy price so far) and calculate
profit = prices[r] - min_price
- all the while keeping track of the max profit encountered

Time Complexity:

- Only loop through the array once in a single pass.
- Each price is processed exactly once, no nested loops, no redundant work.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n).
