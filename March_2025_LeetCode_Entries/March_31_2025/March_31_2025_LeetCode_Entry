LeetCode Problem: Check If Two String Arrays Are Equivalent
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-two-string-arrays-are-equivalent/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, 
and false otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.

- initial thoughts: have to check if concatenating all elements in word1 results in the same string 
as concatenating all elements in word2
- if the two resulting strings are the same, return True, otherwise return False
- we need to concatenate all the elements in both arrays and compare them
- key idea: the order of elements matters, cannot rearrange them
- approach: could use the .join() built in method to concatenate lists into strings

Time Complexity:

- Joining strings using "".join(word1) takes O(n) time, where n is the total number of characters in word1.
- Joining strings using "".join(word2) takes O(m) time, where m is the total number of characters in word2.
- String comparison takes O(min(n, m)) time in the worst case.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n+m).

Space Complexity:

- Summary: The total space complexity is O(n+m) because of storing two new strings, str1 and str2. 

Solution: see attached .py file (Python 3)
