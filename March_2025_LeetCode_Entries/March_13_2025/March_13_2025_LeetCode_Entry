LeetCode Problem: Find All Anagrams in a String
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. 
You may return the answer in any order.

- initial thoughts: have to find an anagram, same characters in a different arrangement, of the
characters in string p within larger search string s
- since the anagram must have exactly the same characters with the same frequency, can use a 
character frequency count, hash map or array
- instead of checking through every possible substring, can use a sliding window to efficiently
move through string s
- the window will always have the same length as string p, because an anagram must match 
the length of string p
- keeping track of the character count inside the window can be used in comparison
with the frequency count of string p
- initial approach: sliding window
- start by building frequency maps for string p and the first window of string s,
which should the size of string p
- slide the window one character at a time
- remove the leftmost character, going out of the window
- add the next character, expanding the window
- compare the frequency counts, if they match, store the index
- continue until scanned all possible windows in string s
- return the list of starting indices where anagrams of string p were found

Time Complexity:

- Iterating over string p once in buld_freq_map(p) takes O(m) time where m = len(p).
- Iterating over the first m characters in string s also takes O(m) time.
- So far, O(m) + O(m) = O(m).
- Comparing two dictionaries (p_count and window_count) takes O(26) = O(1) time 
because there are only at most 26 lowercase letters in the English alphabet.
- So far O(m) + O(1) ~ O(m).
- Sliding the window across string s from index m to n - 1, involves n = len(s).
- Removing leftmost, adding rightmost, and comparing window_count with p_count = O(1).
- Doing this for n - m steps is O(n-m) ~ O(n).
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n).
