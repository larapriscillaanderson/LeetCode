LeetCode Problem: To Lower Case
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/to-lower-case/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a string s, return the string after replacing every uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter.

- initial thoughts: could use built in method .lower()

Time Complexity:

- Each character is processed once.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

Space Complexity:

- A string is created when using the built in .lower().
- Summary: The total space complexity is O(n).

Solution: see attached .py file (Python 3)
