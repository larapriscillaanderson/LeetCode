LeetCode Problem: Merge Strings Alternately
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

- initial thoughts: could use a two pointer approach and keep track of the index to fetch characters
from both strings
- instead of concatenating strings repeatedly (which is slow), 
could store the characters in a list and use ''.join() at the end
- handle the unequal lengths, if word1 is longer, append the remaining part of word1
- if word2 is longer, append the remaining part of word2
- initialize an empty list result to store the merged characters
- iterate through the words up to the length of the shorter word
- append word1[i], then word2[i] to result
- if word1 or word2 has extra characters, append them to result
- use "".join(result) to combine the list into a final string

Time Complexity:

- Iterate through the words once, where N = max(len(word1), len(word2)).
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:

- Store the merged characters in a list before joining them.
- Summary: The total space complexity is O(n).

Solution: see attached .py file (Python 3)
