LeetCode Problem: Binary Subarrays With Sum
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

- initial thoughts: given a binary array made up of 0s and 1s
- need to find contiguous subarrays whose sum equals goal
- subarrays must maintain order, but can vary in length
- the brute-force approach would involve checking all possible subarrays, but that would be inefficent
- key approach: could use a variable sliding window to slide through nums while keeping track of sum
- egde case: if goal = 0, need to count subarrays consisting entirely of zeros

** NOTE: this will take more depth and time to learn, will resume tomorrow. **

Solution: see attached .py file (Python 3) ** just pseudocode because will revisit **

Revisit? Yes
