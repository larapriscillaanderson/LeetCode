LeetCode Problem: Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-word-occurs-as-a-prefix-of-any-word-in-a-sentence/description/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.
Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.
A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

- initial thoughts: given a sentence and a key word
- need to determine if any word in the sentence starts with the given word
- key ideas: could use .split() to first split the sentence into words
- then use the built in method .startswith() to check if it starts with the given prefix
- if any word starts with the prefix, return True
- if no words match, return False

Time Complexity:

- The .split() function will split the sentence into words, which takes O(n), 
- where n is the length of the sentence.
- Looping through each word, worse case, will check each word.
- If there are m words, the time complexity is O(m).
- For each word, checking the prefix with .startswith() takes O(k), 
- where k is the length of the prefix.
- Summary: The total time complexity is therefore O(n+mâ‹…k), where:n is the length of the sentence (due to .split()),m is the number of words in the sentence, andk is the length of the prefix.

Space Complexity:

- Have to store the words in a list after splitting the sentence. 
- The list will have m words, so the space complexity depends on the number of words.
- Summary: The total space complexity is O(m).
