LeetCode Problem: Reverse Words in a String III
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

- initial thoughts: can split the string into words, reverse each word, and then join them back together
- the slicing approach can work well to achieve this [::-1]
- the .split() function breaks a string into words
- the .join() function can help reconstruct the sentence
