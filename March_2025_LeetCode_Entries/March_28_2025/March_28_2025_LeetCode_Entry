LeetCode Problem: Longest Nice Substring
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-nice-substring/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: A string s is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that s contains, 
it appears both in uppercase and lowercase. 
For example, "abABB" is nice because 'A' and 'a' appear, and 'B' and 'b' appear. 
However, "abA" is not because 'b' appears, but 'B' does not.

Given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is nice. 
If there are multiple, return the substring of the earliest occurrence. 
If there are none, return an empty string.

- initial thoughts: need to isolate the "nice" substrings, if there are multiple return the first one
- if no nice substring exists, return an empty string
- key idea: a "nice" string constitutes as one with an uppercase and lowercase version of a letter 
appearing at least once
- a brute force approach to check all the possible substrings might be too slow
- approach: a sliding window could be used to check if both versions of the letter are present in the window
- for each possible substring, intialize a frequency counter to track the characters
- if a nice substring is found, and is longer than the previous ones, have to update the result
- edge case: if the string length is 1 or no nice subtring exists, return an empty string

Time Complexity:

- The while loop runs n times (as the window size decreases from n to 1).
- The inner loop runs O(n) times for each window size.
- The helper function takes O(n) time to check each substring.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops and helper set operations.

Space Complexity:

- Summary: The total space complexity is O(n) for storing substrings and sets.
