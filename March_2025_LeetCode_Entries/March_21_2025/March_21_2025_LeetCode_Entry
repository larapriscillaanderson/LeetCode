LeetCode Problem: Split a String in Balanced Strings
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-in-balanced-strings/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:

Each substring is balanced.
Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.

- initial thoughts: since the string is already balanced, have to find the 
smallest balanced parts through traversal
- key idea: it not necessary to store substrings, just count how many balanced portions
can be created
- a running counter approach could work, when the counts are equal, have found
a balanced substring
- use a counter, balance = 0, to keep track of the difference between left and right
- increment for left, decrement for right
- initialize a count, count = 0, to track how many substrings are found
- update balance throughout the iteration, return count at the end

Time Complexity:

- Only traverse the string once.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n).
