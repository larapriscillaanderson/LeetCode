LeetCode Problem: Maximum Average Subarray I
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

- initial thoughts: since the goal involves returning a contiguous subarray,
cannot rearrange elements
- could use a sliding window approach to keep track of the sum
- instead of computing the sum for every subarray, maintain a running sum of k elements
- as the iteration continues, substract the outgoing element and add the incoming element
to update the sum in constant time
- key idea: keep track of the maximum sum while iterating
- calculate the maximum average by dividing the max sum by k

Time Complexity:

- Computing the first window sum (sum(nums[:k])) is O(k).
- Sliding the window across the array is a loop that runs (n-k) times
(for i in range(k, len(nums))) is O(n - k) â‰ˆ O(n).
- Returning the result is just simple division (max_sum / k), O(1).
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n).
