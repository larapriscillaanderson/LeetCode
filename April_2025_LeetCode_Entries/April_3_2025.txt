# LeetCode
Executive LeetCode Journal

Day 93 of 365...

♻️ Update: Welcome to my Executive LeetCode Journal where I track my progress, reinforce learning, 
and apply structured problem-solving techniques. 

The month of April follows a pattern-based sprint using a structured operational and efficient design.

April 3, 2025: Continuing NeetCode Python for Beginners Course

Resources:

1. NeetCode Python for Beginners: Reinforce core concepts

2. Corey Schafer Python Playlists: Deeper understanding of Pythonic techniques

3. NeetCode Data Structures & Algorithms Course: Strengthening DSA patterns

4. Python Tricks by Dan Bader: Advanced Python techniques & best practices

💡 Future Considerations: Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, CodeAcademy, DataCamp, Microsoft Azure Certifications

Today:

April 3, 2025 - Problem/Concept of the Day: NeetCode Python for Beginners Course

⚛️ Focus Area: Variables

🆘 LeetCode Problem: [Problem Name]

⭕️ Link: [Insert LeetCode URL] 🔺 Level: [Easy | Medium | Hard]

💡 Notes & Thought Process:

    🧐 Initial Thoughts: [What I initially considered]

    Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
    Variable names can't start with a number.
    Variable names can't contain spaces.
    Variable names can't be the same as Python keywords like for, if, etc.

    🤩 Approach: [Techniques considered: Sliding Window, Two Pointers, DP, etc.]

    🥳 Optimizations: [Brute force → optimized approach]

    age = 25             # integer
    temperature = 98.6   # floating-point number
    is_true = True       # boolean
    name = "Alice"       # string
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # list

    😎 Challenges & Mistakes: [Where I struggled, how I fixed it]

✅ Progress Tracking:

    ✅ Completed: [List concepts covered]

    Introduction Lessons 6-15

    🚧 In Progress: [Topics still working on]

    Lessons 16-81

    ❤️‍🔥 Need to Revisit: [Concepts that need more work] 

📚 Things I Would Teach Someone Else:

    ❓ [Key concept or technique summarized in my own words]

    - just use snake case for everything for good measure, except classes

    ⚠️ [Common mistake & how to avoid it]

    - catch errors and debug with static typing, employed by many languages on purpose
    - var = None, declare empty variables with None for placeholder 

    🔱 [Best analogy or real-world example]

    - consistency in naming helps readability for others and yourself upon revisitation
    - just avoid dynamic typing

🎯 Next Steps & Plan for Tomorrow:

    ✨ What is the focus for the next session? Any gaps to close?

    - Dedicate more hours to go through the lessons faster.

📊 Overall Monthly Progress Tracker:

    ✅ April 1, 2025: restructure journal and plan new topics for month long sprint

    ✅ April 2, 2025: begin NeetCode Python for Beginners course

    ✅ April 3, 2025: continue NeetCode Python for Beginners course
