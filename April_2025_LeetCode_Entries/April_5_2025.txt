# LeetCode
Executive LeetCode Journal

Day 95 of 365...

♻️ Update: Welcome to my Executive LeetCode Journal where I track my progress, reinforce learning, 
and apply structured problem-solving techniques. 

The month of April follows a pattern-based sprint using a structured operational and efficient design.

April 5, 2025: Continuing NeetCode Python for Beginners Course

Resources:

1. NeetCode Python for Beginners: Reinforce core concepts

2. Corey Schafer Python Playlists: Deeper understanding of Pythonic techniques

3. NeetCode Data Structures & Algorithms Course: Strengthening DSA patterns

4. Python Tricks by Dan Bader: Advanced Python techniques & best practices

💡 Future Considerations: Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, CodeAcademy, DataCamp, Microsoft Azure Certifications

Today:

April 5, 2025 - Problem/Concept of the Day: NeetCode Python for Beginners Course

⚛️ Focus Area: Functions

🆘 LeetCode Problem: [Problem Name]

⭕️ Link: [Insert LeetCode URL] 🔺 Level: [Easy | Medium | Hard]

💡 Notes & Thought Process:

    🧐 Initial Thoughts: [What I initially considered]

    🤩 Approach: [Techniques considered: Sliding Window, Two Pointers, DP, etc.]

    🥳 Optimizations: [Brute force → optimized approach]

    Global Scope:
    - Variables declared outside of any function have a global scope.
    - They can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including inside functions.

    Local Scope:
    - Variables declared within a function have a local scope.
    - They can only be accessed within the function in which they are defined.
    - Local variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.

    😎 Challenges & Mistakes: [Where I struggled, how I fixed it]

    Parameter is a variable in a function definition. 
    Arguments are the data you pass into the function's parameters when a function is called.

    ex:

    def greet(name):
    msg = "Hello, " + name
    print(msg)

    greet("Alice")  # This will print "Hello, Alice"

    # parameter is name
    # argument is Alice
    # you can change the argument to pass in a different name, but the parameter will still be name

    ❤️‍🔥 Need to Revisit: [Concepts that need more work] 

📚 Things I Would Teach Someone Else:

    ❓ [Key concept or technique summarized in my own words]

    - type hints for parameters help the reader or other developers understand what type of 
    data the function expects to receive and return
    - type hints can also indicate the function will return nothing

    ex:

    def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

    def greet(name: str) -> None:
    print("Hello, " + name)

    ⚠️ [Common mistake & how to avoid it]

    - if you have a parameter with a default value, all parameters after it must also have default values

    ex:

    # This is valid
    def greet(greeting="Hello", name="world"):
        print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

    # This is valid
    def greet(greeting, name="world"):
        print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

    # This is NOT valid
    def greet(greeting="Hello", name):
        print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

    # the last version is not allowed because you cannot pass in an empty argument first
    # it also looks weird
    # greet(, "")

    🔱 [Best analogy or real-world example]

🎯 Next Steps & Plan for Tomorrow:

    ✨ What is the focus for the next session? Any gaps to close?

    - Dedicate more hours to go through the lessons faster.
