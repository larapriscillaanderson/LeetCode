# LeetCode
Executive LeetCode Journal

Day 96 of 365...

♻️ Update: Welcome to my Executive LeetCode Journal where I track my progress, reinforce learning, 
and apply structured problem-solving techniques. 

The month of April follows a pattern-based sprint using a structured operational and efficient design.

April 6, 2025: Continuing NeetCode Python for Beginners Course

Resources:

1. NeetCode Python for Beginners: Reinforce core concepts

2. Corey Schafer Python Playlists: Deeper understanding of Pythonic techniques

3. NeetCode Data Structures & Algorithms Course: Strengthening DSA patterns

4. Python Tricks by Dan Bader: Advanced Python techniques & best practices

💡 Future Considerations: Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, CodeAcademy, DataCamp, Microsoft Azure Certifications

Today:

April 6, 2025 - Problem/Concept of the Day: NeetCode Python for Beginners Course

⚛️ Focus Area: Condiitonal Statements

🆘 LeetCode Problem: [Problem Name]

⭕️ Link: [Insert LeetCode URL] 🔺 Level: [Easy | Medium | Hard]

💡 Notes & Thought Process:

    🧐 Initial Thoughts: [What I initially considered]

    Comparison Operators Overview:

    == Equal to
    != Not equal to
    < Less than
    > Greater than
    <= Less than or equal to
    >= Greater than or equal to

    🤩 Approach: [Techniques considered: Sliding Window, Two Pointers, DP, etc.]

    🥳 Optimizations: [Brute force → optimized approach]

    - A value is falsy if it is:

        False (boolean)     
        None (NoneType)
        0 (integer)
        0.0 (float)
        "" (empty string)
        [] (empty list)
        Most other empty collections (e.g. empty tuple, empty set, empty dictionary)

    - A value is truthy if it is:

        True (boolean)
        All integers other than 0
        All floats other than 0.0
        All strings other than ""
        All collections with at least one element

    ex:

    msg = ""
    if msg:
        print("Message is not empty.") # This will not be printed

    msg = "Hello, World!"
    if msg:
        print("Message is not empty.") # This will be printed

    😎 Challenges & Mistakes: [Where I struggled, how I fixed it]

    🚧 In Progress: [Topics still working on]

    Lessons 38-81

    ❤️‍🔥 Need to Revisit: [Concepts that need more work] 

📚 Things I Would Teach Someone Else:

    ❓ [Key concept or technique summarized in my own words]

    - unlike functions, if statements do not create a new scope
    - variables defined inside an if statement are accessible outside of the if statement

    ex:

    if True:
        message = "Hello"

    print(message)  # This will print "Hello"

    ⚠️ [Common mistake & how to avoid it]

    - within functions, if statements have the same scope as the function
    - this means that variables defined inside an if statement are accessible within that function,
    but not outside of it

    ex:

    def is_balance_low(balance: int):
        if balance <= 100:
            message = "Warning: Low balance."
        print(message)

    is_balance_low(50)  # This will print "Warning: Low balance."
    print(message)  # This will cause an error

    🔱 [Best analogy or real-world example]

🎯 Next Steps & Plan for Tomorrow:

    ✨ What is the focus for the next session? Any gaps to close?

    - Dedicate more hours to go through the lessons faster.
