LeetCode Problem: Find the Difference
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

- initial thoughts: t string contains all the letters of s plus one more letter, random spot
- need to find the extra letter
- could use a hash map approach to count character frequencies in s
- loop through t, decrement counts from hash map
- the letter with a negative or missing count is the extra letter
- key idea: iterate through string t, checking if character count goes below zero
