LeetCode Problem: Missing Number
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], 
return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

- initial thoughts: have an array of n distinct numbers
- the range is from 0 to n (inclusive)
- one number is missing from the range
- need to find and return the missing number
- key idea: since one number is missing, the array length is n, 
but the range has n + 1 elements
- could use a sum formula approach
- the sum of numbers should be n(n + 1) / 2
- the missing number = expected sum - actual sum

Time Complexity:

- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n) because iterate through nums once for sum(nums).
