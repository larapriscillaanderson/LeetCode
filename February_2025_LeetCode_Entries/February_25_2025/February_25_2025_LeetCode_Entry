LeetCode Problem: Jewels and Stones
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

- initial thoughts: have to count how many stones are jewels,
could use a set (or dictionary) for quick lookups
- jewels: a string representing the types of stones that are jewels,
each character is a unique jewel type
- stones: a string representing the stones you have,
each character is a stone type
- goal is to return the number of stones that are also jewels
- store all jewel characters in a set
- iterate through stones and count how many exist in the set

Time Complexity:

- Converting the 'jewels' string into a set takes O(J), where J is the length of 'jewels'.
- Iterating through 'stones' and checking membership in the set takes O(S), 
where S is the length of 'stones'.
- Summary: the total time complexity is O(J + S).

Space Complexity:

- The set 'jewel_set' stores unique jewel types, requiring O(J) space.
- No additional data structures of significant size are used.
- Summary: the total space complexity is O(J).

Solution: see attached .py file (Python 3)
