LeetCode Problem: 3Sum
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets 
[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, 
and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

- initial approach: find three numbers that sum up to zero, 
similar to the two-sum problem but with three elements instead of two
- sort the array to avoid duplicate triplets
- sorting will also make it easier to use a two-pointer approach
- use a loop like nums[i] to fix one number
- once one number is fixed, two remain
- the remaining two can be nums[left] and nums[right] = complement
- the equation would then be: complement = -nums[i] (so nums[left] + nums[right] = -nums[i])
