LeetCode Problem: Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/subtract-the-product-and-sum-of-digits-of-an-integer/ 

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

- initial thoughts: need to extract each digit, compute both product and sum, 
then return their difference
- convert n into individual digits for an easy calculation
- initialize product as 1 and sum as 0
- loop through each digit using a for loop
- multiply product by the digit
- add the digit to sum
- return product - sum

Time Complexity:

- Converting n to a string and then iterating through its digits takes O(d) time,
where d is the number of digits in n.
- Inside the loop, both multiplication and addition operations are O(1).
- Summary: Since the number of digits in n is at most log(n) (base 10), 
the total time complexity is O(log n).

Space Complexity:

- Storing the digits as a list takes O(d) space, where d is the number of digits in n.
- Other variables (product and sum_digits) use O(1) space.
- Summary: Since the number of digits is at most log(n), 
the total space complexity is O(log n) due to storing the digit list.
