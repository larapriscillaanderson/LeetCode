Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/subtract-the-product-and-sum-of-digits-of-an-integer/ 

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

- initial thoughts: need to extract each digit, compute both product and sum, 
then return their difference
- convert n into individual digits for an easy calculation
- initialize product as 1 and sum as 0
- loop through each digit using a for loop
- multiply product by the digit
- add the digit to sum
- return product - sum
