LeetCode Problem: First Unique Character in a String
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. 
If it does not exist, return -1.

- initial thoughts: could use a hash map approach to count the occurrences 
of each character
- but since the goal is to find the first non-repeating character, the order
should be preserved
- initialize an empty dictionary
- if the character is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
- if the character is already in the dictionary, increment its count
- iterate through s again to find the first character with a count of 1 in the dictionary
- return the index, otherwise if not found return -1 

Time Complexity:

- Iterating through s to populate character_count takes O(n).
- Iterating through s again to find the first unique character takes O(n), worst case.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(n).

Space Complexity:

- Dictionary character_count stores counts for up to n unique characters, 
leading to O(n), worst case.
- Summary: The total space complexity is O(n).
