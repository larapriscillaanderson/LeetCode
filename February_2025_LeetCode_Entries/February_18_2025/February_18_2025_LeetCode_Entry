LeetCode Problem: Fibonacci Number
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).

- initial thoughts: requires computing the Fibonacci number at index n, 
where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers
- use an iterative approach with a list to store computed values
- base case: the Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1,
initialize the first two numbers in a list
- start iterating loop from index 2 up to n - 1 (since Python uses zero-based indexing)
- compute the next Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two
- append the computed value to the list
- final step: return the n-1th index from the list, as lists are zero-based
