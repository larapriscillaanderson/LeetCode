LeetCode Problem: Majority Element
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. 
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

- initial thoughts: have to count the occurrences of each number 
and find the one appearing more than n / 2 times
- initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts
- iterate through nums and update counts in the dictionary
- if the number is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
- if it already exists, increment the count
- check if any element's count exceeds n / 2
- return the element
