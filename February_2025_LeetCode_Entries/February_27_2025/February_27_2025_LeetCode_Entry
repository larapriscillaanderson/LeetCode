LeetCode Problem: Valid Sudoku
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/ 

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

- initial thoughts: given a 9 x 9 Sudoku board, but it may be partially filled
- goal is to check the board validity under certain conditions
- each row must have unique digits (1-9)
- each column must have unique digits (1-9)
- each 3 x 3 sub-box must have unique digits (1-9)
- Note: the board may be incomplete, but goal is to just check validity
- empty cells are represented as '.' and can be ignored
- initial approach: could use a hash map for a variety of purposes
- a set for each row to track seen numbers
- a set for each column to track seen numbers
- a set for each 3 x 3 sub-box to track seen numbers
- loop through each cell (r, c) in the board
- check if the cell contains a number (1-9)
- check the row set, if a number already exists, return False
- check the column set, if a number already exists, return False
- check the sub-box set, calculate which 3 x 3 box it belongs to using
the formula (r // 3, c // 3)
- add the number to the corresponding sets if it's not found
- if it completes the iterations without violations, return True

Time Complexity:

- Iterating through all 81 cells in the 9x9 board once, making the time complexity O(81) = O(1) (constant time).
- Checking and inserting into a set takes O(1) time, so all operations within each cell run in constant time.
- Summary: Since we only perform a fixed number of operations per cell, the total time complexity remains O(1).

Space Complexity:

- Store sets for 9 rows, 9 columns, and 9 boxes, each holding at most 9 elements, 
leading to O(9 × 3) = O(1) space.
- Each set stores at most 9 unique numbers, making the space usage bounded by a constant.
- Summary: Don’t use extra data structures proportional to input size, 
the overall space complexity remains O(1).
