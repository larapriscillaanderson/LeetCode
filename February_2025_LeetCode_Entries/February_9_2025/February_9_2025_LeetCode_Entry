LeetCode Problem: Group Anagrams
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. 
You can return the answer in any order.

- initial thoughts: two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in
the same frequency
- a hash map approach can be used based on the unique key representing
character composition
- groups need to be returned, so a hash map should map the anagram pattern
to a list of words that match
- key: a unique signature for each anagram (sorted tuple of letters)
- value: a list of words that match the signature
- initialize an empty dictionary to store the anagram groups
- iterate through the list of strings
- convert each word to a sorted tuple
- "eat" -> ('a', 'e', 't')
- check if the sorted tuple exists in the dictionary
- if not, initialize it with an empty list (anagrams[key] = [])
- append the word to the corresponding list
- return the values of the dictionary, which are the grouped anagrams,
but they are in a list of lists form

Time Complexity:

- Each word is sorted individually, which takes O(k log k) time,
where k is the length of the word.
- Process each word once, contributing O(n) to the runtime.
- Both inserting into and looking up in a dictionary take O(1) on average.
- Extracting dictionary values takes O(n).
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n * k log k), 
since each word requires sorting and the process goes through n words.
