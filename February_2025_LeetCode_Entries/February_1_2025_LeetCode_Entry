LeetCode Problem: Intersection of Two Arrays
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. 
Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

- initial thoughts: need to find the intersection of two arrays, without duplicates
- a hash set approach is ideal because it allows for O(1) time for lookups
- convert nums1 into a set to allow for easy lookups and duplicate removal
- iterate through nums2, checking if each element exists in the nums1 set
- store the elements in a separate results set
