LeetCode Problem: Intersection of Two Arrays
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. 
Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

- initial thoughts: need to find the intersection of two arrays, without duplicates
- a hash set approach is ideal because it allows for O(1) time for lookups
- convert nums1 into a set to allow for easy lookups and duplicate removal
- iterate through nums2, checking if each element exists in the nums1 set
- store the elements in a separate results set

Time Complexity:

- Converting nums1 into a set takes O(n) time, where n is the length of nums1.
- Iterating through nums2 takes O(m) time, where m is the length of nums2.
- The if num in set1 operation is an O(1) average-time lookup because Python sets use a hash table.
- Adding elements to the result set is an O(1) operation on average since set insertions are also hash-based.
- Converting the final set into a list takes O(k) time, where k is the size of the intersection.
- Summary: The total time complexity O(n + m).
