LeetCode Problem: Top K Frequent Elements
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. 
You may return the answer in any order.

- initial thoughts: this requires finding the k most frequent elements in an array
- a hash map approach can be used to count the occurrences of each element
- need a way to extract the top k elements based on the frequency
- a heap (priority queue) is useful for this, since it can retrieve the largest k elements
- key: the element from the array
- value: the count of occurrences of that element
- initialize an empty dictionary to store element counts
- iterate through the list and populate the dictionary (num_counts[element] = frequency)
- use a heap (min-heap of size k) to keep track of the top k elements
- if the heap exceeds size k, remove the smallest frequency element
- extract the k most frequent elements from the heap and return them
