LeetCode Problem: 4Sum
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an array nums of n integers, return an array of all the unique quadruplets
[nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]] such that:

0 <= a, b, c, d < n
a, b, c, and d are distinct.
nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target
You may return the answer in any order.

- initial approach: find four numbers that sum up to the target, 
could use twosum hash map idea/simple dictionary
- sort the array to avoid duplicate quadruplets
- sorting will also make it easier to use a two-pointer approach
- use a nested loop like nums[i] and nums[j] to fix two numbers
- once two numbers are found, two remain
- the remaining two can be nums[left] and nums[right] = complement
- the equation would then be complement = target - nums[i] - nums[j]
