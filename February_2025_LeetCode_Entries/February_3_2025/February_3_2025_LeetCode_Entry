LeetCode Problem: Find Closest Number to Zero
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-number-to-zero/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. 
If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

- initial thoughts: have to deal with the edge case of an empty array and integrate absolute value somehow
- if nums is empty, return 0
- set closest to the first element in nums
- loop through each number in nums, using a for loop
- if the absolute value of num is smaller than the absolute value of closest,
update closest to num
- if the absolute values are the same but num is larger than closest,
update closest to num
- return the closest number

Time Complexity:

- Iterating through the nums array only once is O(n) time.
- Inside the loop, all operations (absolute value, comparison, and assignment) are O(1).
- Summary: Since there are no nested loops or extra iterations, the total time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:

- To use a single variable closest to store the result is just O(1).
- No additional data structures are created (like lists, dictionaries, etc).
- Summary: Since the space usage does not grow with input size, the total space complexity is O(1).

Solution: see attached .py file (Python 3)
