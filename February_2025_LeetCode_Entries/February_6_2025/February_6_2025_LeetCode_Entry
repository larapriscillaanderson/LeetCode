LeetCode Problem: Majority Element II
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊n / 3⌋ times.

- initial thoughts: could use a hash map approach to count the occurrences 
of each number and find the one appearing more than n / 3 times
- initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts
- iterate through nums and update counts in the dictionary
- if the number is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
- filter the dictionary to collect elements appearing more than n / 3 times
- return the list of the valid majority elements
