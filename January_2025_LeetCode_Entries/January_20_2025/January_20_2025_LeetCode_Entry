LeetCode Problem: Palindrome Number REVISITED
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/ 

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

- if x is negative, immediately return False
- use a while loop to reverse the digits
- extract the last digit with x % 10
- append it to reversed_number by multiplying the current reversed number by 10 
and adding the last digit
- remove the last digit from x with integer division x //= 10
- if the reversed number matches the original number, itâ€™s a palindrome

Time Complexity:

- The number of digits in the input number x determines the number of
iterations in the while loop.
- If the number x has n digits, the loop runs approximately n times.
- Extracting the last digit using x % 10 takes constant time: O(1).
- Removing the last digit using x //= 10 also takes constant time: O(1).
- The loop runs for about half of the digits when reversing half the number 
or all digits when reversing the full number.
- Summary: If n is the number of digits in x, the overall time complexity is O(n).
