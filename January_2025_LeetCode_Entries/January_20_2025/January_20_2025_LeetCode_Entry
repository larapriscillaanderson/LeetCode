Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/ 

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

- if x is negative, immediately return False
- use a while loop to reverse the digits
- extract the last digit with x % 10
- append it to reversed_number by multiplying the current reversed number by 10 
and adding the last digit
- remove the last digit from x with integer division x //= 10
- if the reversed number matches the original number, itâ€™s a palindrome
