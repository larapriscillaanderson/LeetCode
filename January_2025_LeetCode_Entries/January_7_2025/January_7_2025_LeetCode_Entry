Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/   

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

- first check for empty input, return an empty string "" if the input array strs is empty
- initialize the prefix, start with the first string in the array as the initial prefix
- iterate through the array, compare the prefix with each subsequent string in the array
- while the current string does not start with the prefix, trim the last character from the prefix
- stop trimming when the current string starts with the prefix or the prefix becomes empty
- after comparing with all strings, return the final prefix
