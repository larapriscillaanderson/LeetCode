LeetCode Problem: Power of Two
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/  

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2^x.

- first check if n is negative, because negative numbers and zero are not powers of two
- good to know: a power of two has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation
- 1 = 0001, 2 = 0010, 4 = 0100, 8 = 1000
- could potentially approach this using bitwise operators
- however, a more beginner approach would be to use a while loop
- continuously divide and check for a remainder of 0 
- if n is not a power of two, the division will eventually stop at a non 1 value
- Note: use integer floor division // to produce an integer, 
float division / would produce a floating number
