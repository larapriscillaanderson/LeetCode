LeetCode Problem: Palindrome Number
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/ 

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

- [::-1] this is [start:end: step]
- [::1] starting from the beginning and going to the end with a step of 1, same as [0:len(sequence):1]
- [::-1] start at the end and going towards the beginning with a step of -1, effectively reversing the sequence
- Note: if the parameter is an integer, use str() conversion
