LeetCode Problem: Daily Temperatures
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

- initial thoughts: this can be solved using a monotonic stack approach
- first, for each day find out how many days ahead the temperature is warmer
- if no such day exists, return 0 for that day
- use a stack to keep track of indices of the temperatures array
- traverse the array from left to right
- hile the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the 
temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack
- then pop the stack to get the index of the previous day
- compute the difference in days (current_index - stack_top_index) and store it in the result array
- push the current index onto the stack
- at the end, any indices left in the stack will have 0 in the result because no warmer day exists

Time Complexity:

- Outer Loop: runs n times (once for each day in temperatures).
- Worst case for each day, the inner loop scans all remaining days to find a warmer temperature.
- For example, if temperatures = [1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 100], the inner loop will run almost the entire length for each outer loop iteration.
- Summary: The overall time complexity is O(n^2).
