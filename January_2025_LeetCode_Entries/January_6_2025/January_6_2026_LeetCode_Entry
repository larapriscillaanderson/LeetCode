LeetCode Problem: PlusOne
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/  

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

- initialize the carry, start with a value of 1
- iterates backwards by traversing the digits array from the last digit (least significant) to the first (most significant)
- add the carry to the current digit.
- update the current digit to the remainder when divided by 10 (digits[i] = total % 10)
- update the carry to the quotient when divided by 10 (carry = total // 10)
- this determines if there’s an overflow to handle in the next significant digit
- if there’s still a carry left after processing all digits, insert it at the beginning of the array
- the updated digits array represents the incremented number
