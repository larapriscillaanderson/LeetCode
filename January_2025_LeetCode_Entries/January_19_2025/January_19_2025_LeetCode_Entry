LeetCode Problem: FizzBuzz
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/description/

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

- initial thoughts: create an empty list called answer to store the results
- loop through numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)
- check if the current number i is divisible by both 3 and 5
- if true, append "FizzBuzz" to the list
- else, check if the number i is divisible by 3. If true, append "Fizz"
- if not, check if the number i is divisible by 5. If true, append "Buzz"
- if none of the above conditions are met, append the number i as a string to the list
- return the answer list after processing all numbers

Time Complexity:

- We loop through numbers from 1 to n, and for each number, we perform constant-time checks and append operations. The overall time complexity is linear with respect to n.
- Summary: Total time complexity is O(n).
