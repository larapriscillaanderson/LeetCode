LeetCode Problem: Search Insert Position
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/  

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

- initial thoughts: the O(log n) runtime is a hint to use binary search
- O(log n) usually involves halving the search space with each iteration
- iterate through the array but using a midpoint calculation as a base
- then search for the target by comparing it to this midpoint
- if the target is greater than the midpoint, then search in the right half
- if the target is less than the midpoint, then search in the left half
- if the target is not found, left points to the insertion index
