LeetCode Problem: Goal Parser Interpretation 
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/goal-parser-interpretation/  

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

Given the string command, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of command.

- initial thoughts: loop through the string and replace every period (".") with [.]
- return the updated string
- key operation: use .replace()

Time Complexity:

- The .replace() method runs in O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- The method scans the string once and performs a replacement operation for each period ("."), which is done in O(n) time.
- Summary: The overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because 
.replace() iterates through the string once.

Space Complexity:

- The input string address is given, so its space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- We create a new string for the result. This string will also be of length O(n) because we replace each period with [.], but the size remains the same.
- We don't use any additional data structures like lists or dictionaries, so no extra memory is used beyond the result string.
- Summary: The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we create a new string to store the defanged version of the IP address.

Solution: see attached .py file (Python 3)
