LeetCode Problem: Plus One REVISITED
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/  

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

- instead of using the carry method, try an alternative approach iterating from the last digit backward
- for each digit, if the digit is less than 9 increment the digit by 1
- return the updated array immeidately
- otherwise, set the digit to 0
- if you finish the loop (all digits were 9), prepend a 1 to the array
- ([9, 9, 9] becomes [1, 0, 0, 0]), and return the updated array

Time Complexity:

- Best Case:
- If the last digit is not 9, the loop exits immediately after processing the last digit.
- This means the algorithm only performs 1 iteration, O(1).
- Worst Case: (all digits are 9)
- The loop needs to process all digits since each digit is 9 and must be set to 0.
- After processing all digits, the algorithm prepends 1 to the array.
- Here it would be O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(1) (best case) to O(n) (worst case).
