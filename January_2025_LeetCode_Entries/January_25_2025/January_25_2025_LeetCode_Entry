LeetCode Problem: Plus One REVISITED
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/  

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

- instead of using the carry method, try an alternative approach iterating from the last digit backward
- for each digit, if the digit is less than 9 increment the digit by 1
- return the updated array immeidately
- otherwise, set the digit to 0
- if you finish the loop (all digits were 9), prepend a 1 to the array
- ([9, 9, 9] becomes [1, 0, 0, 0]), and return the updated array
