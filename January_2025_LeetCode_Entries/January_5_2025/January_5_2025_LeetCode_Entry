LeetCode Problem: Sqrt(x)
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/ 

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

- a binary search approach can be used to solve this problem
- the first leg of the problem must tackle simple square roots, such as 0 and 1
- if the number is either 0 or 1, return the number
- binary search is performed between 1 and x because the square root of any number x > 1 will always lie in this range
- the loop will continue as long as the left remains of a lesser value than the right
- the midpoint calculation will be found through the current search range mid = left + (right - left) // 2
- if mid^2 == x, you've found the square root and return it
- if mid^2 < x, the square root lies to the right of mid, then left becomes mid + 1
- otherwise, the square root lies to the left of mid, then right becomes mid - 1
- when the loop ends, right will be the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x

Time Complexity: 

- The binary search operates on a range from 1 to x, continuously halving the search space at each step.
- For each iteration, there is a midpoint calculation, and a comparison check.
- Midpoint calculation: mid = left + (right - left) // 2
- Comparison check: mid * mid == x, mid * mid < x, mid * mid > x
- These are constant time operations, O(1).
- Summary: Because the search space is halved in each iteration, this results in a logarithmic time complexity, O(logx) where x is the input number.
