LeetCode Problem: Valid Palindrome
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/ 

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, 
or false otherwise.

- there are 2 ways to solve this, one is using .alnum
- the other is by using your own alpha numeric checker with ASCII symbols A-Z, a-z, 0-9 
- the other way uses L and R pointers
- run a while loop while the L != R
- end the loop with incrementing L and decrementing R

Time Complexity: 

- The isalnum() function is designed to check a single character to determine if it’s alphanumeric.
Since it doesn’t depend on the size of the string or other variables, 
its execution time remains constant O(1).
- After the loop finishes, there is a check to see if new_string is equal to its reverse. 
- Reversing a string takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the string. 
- Summary: Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.
