LeetCode Problem: Valid Palindrome
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/ 

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, 
or false otherwise.

- there are 2 ways to solve this, one is using .alnum
- the other is by using your own alpha numeric checker with ASCII symbols A-Z, a-z, 0-9 
- the other way uses L and R pointers
- run a while loop while the L != R
- end the loop with incrementing L and decrementing R
