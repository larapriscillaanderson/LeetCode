LeetCode Problem: Valid Anagram 
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/ 

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

- initial thoughts: can approach this problem using a dictionary (hash map)
to store the frequency of each character in s.
- first check if the lengths of the strings are equal, because anagrams must have
the same amount of characters.
- use a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in s.
- loop through each character in s and update its count in the dictionary.
- loop through each character in t and for each character decrease its count
in the dictionary.
- if a character in t is not in the dictionary or its count becomes negative,
return False
- if all counts in the dictionary are zero, return true.
