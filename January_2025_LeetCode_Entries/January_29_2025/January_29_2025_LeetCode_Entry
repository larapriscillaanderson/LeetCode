LeetCode Problem: Search a 2D Matrix
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/

Level: Medium

**Notes:**

Goal: You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

- initial thoughts: the matrix has two key properties
- each row is sorted, and the first integer of each row is greater than the 
last integer of the previous row
- the matrix can be mapped back into a 1D array by using a 2D coordinate system (row, col)
- row = index // n
- col = index % n
- can use a classic binary search approach, since the number of total elements is m * n
- initialize left and right pointers as left = 0 and right = m * n - 1
- calculate middle index mid = (left + right) // 2
- convert mid back to 2D coordinates, row = mid // n, col = mid % n
- compare matrix[row][col] with target
- if matrix[row][col] == target, return True
- if matrix[row][col] < target, move left to mid + 1
- if matrix[row][col] > target, move right to mid - 1
- if the loop ends, return False

Time Complexity:

- There are operations that simply retrieve the number of rows and columns, 
which take constant time.
- m = len(matrix): O(1)
- n = len(matrix[0]): O(1)
- The number of elements in the matrix is m * n.
- Binary search runs in O(log K) time, where K is the total number of elements.
- Here, K = m * n, so the time complexity is O(log (m * n)).
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(log (m * n)).

Space Complexity:

- Only using a few integer variables (left, right, mid, row, col).
- No extra data structures are used.
- Summary: The total space complexity is O(1) (constant space).
