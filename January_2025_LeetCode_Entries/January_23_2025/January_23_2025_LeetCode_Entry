Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/   

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

- start with the first string as the initial assumption for the prefix
- terate through all strings in the list, checking if the current string starts with the prefix
- if it doesnâ€™t, shorten the prefix by removing the last character
- if the prefix becomes empty at any point, return an empty string
- at the end of the loop, the prefix will be the longest common prefix
