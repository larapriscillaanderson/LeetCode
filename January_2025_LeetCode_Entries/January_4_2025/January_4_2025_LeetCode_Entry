LeetCode Problem: Single Number
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/  

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. 
Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

- there are 2 ways to solve this, one is using XOR
- the other is by using a dictionary to store counts
- if the number exists in the dictionary, then increment the count
- otherwise the initial count is 1

Time Complexity: 

- Building the dictionary involves iterating through the input array nums.
- Each check (num in count) and operation (count[num] += 1 or count[num] = 1) is constant time O(1).
- Thus, iterating through all n elements takes O(n) time.
- After the loop, have to iterate through the dictionary’s key-value pairs using .items() to find the number with a count of 1.
- In the worst case, this involves checking k unique elements, where k ≤ n.
- Checking all k keys has a time complexity of O(k), which simplifies to O(n) since k ≤ n.
- Summary: The total time complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(n), where n is the length of 
the input array nums.
