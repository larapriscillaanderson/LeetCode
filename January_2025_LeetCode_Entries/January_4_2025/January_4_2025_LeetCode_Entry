LeetCode Problem: Single Number
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/  

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. 
Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

- there are 2 ways to solve this, one is using XOR
- the other is by using a dictionary to store counts
- if the number exists in the dictionary, then increment the count
- otherwise the initial count is 1
