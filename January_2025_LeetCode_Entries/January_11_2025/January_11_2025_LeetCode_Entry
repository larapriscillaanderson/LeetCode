LeetCode Problem: Goal Parser Interpretation 
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/goal-parser-interpretation/  

Level: Easy

**Notes:**

Goal: You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command consists of an alphabet of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret "G" as the string "G", "()" as the string "o", and "(al)" as the string "al". The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.

Given the string command, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of command.

- initial thoughts: the input consists of the characters "G", "()", and "(al)"
- need to replace "()" with "o" and "(al)" with "al", while keeping "G" unchanged
- this suggests a simple string replacement approach
- since "()" and "(al)" always appear in fixed forms, we can directly replace them using .replace()
- "G" stays the same, so we don't need to modify it
- perform the replacements in order:
- replace "()" with "o"
- replace "(al)" with "al"
- return the transformed string
- key operations: .replace("()", "o") to replace "()" with "o" and
use .replace("(al)", "al") to replace "(al)" with "al"
