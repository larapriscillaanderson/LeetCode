- 🧰 Key Tools / Services Introduced: 
    - AWS: Amazon S3, EC2, Amazon RDS, and DynamoDB

- 🛠️ Architecture Notes:  

- Cloud computing seeks to solve 3 problems:
    1. scalability
    2. performance
    3. **fault tolerance** - a system's ability to continue operating without interruption despite failures or faults in one of more of its components
- Solution: public cloud providers offer a web of globally interconnected servers to achieve scalability, high performance, and fault tolerance while avoiding costs associated with infrastructure maintenance and management.
- Benefit: Huge economies of scale from setting up global systems.
- Side note: **economy of scale** is a proportionate saving in cost gained through an increased level of production.
- The Cloud: a vast network of globally distributed servers that work together to store and deliver data, run applications, and deliver services over the internet.
- IT Infrastructure: traditionally is a capital expense, upfront cost, capacity guessing game.
- **The Cloud:** operational expense, pay as you go.

- Development of Amazon Web Services:
    - The data centers Amazon built had a lot of excess capacity.
    - In 2003, they identified 3 key services to have a viable cloud product:
        1. compute
        2. storage
        3. databases
    - In 2006, first **Amazon Web Services** launched, **Amazon S3, Amazon Simple Storage Service** and **EC2, Elastic Compute Cloud.**
    - Amazon S3 is an infinitely scalable object storage service (files, photos, etc.).
    - Amazon EC2 allows users to provision their own virtual servers hosted by AWS (public and private).
    - In 2009, Amazon launches **RDS, Amazon Relational Database Service.**
    - You could technically already run relational databases on EC2, but RDS is different.
    - Amazon RDS is a managed service, where AWS handles most of the operational overhead for you.
    - Before 2009, if you wanted to run a relational database (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server on AWS), you'd have to launch an EC2 virtual machine.
    - You would also have to manually install the database software on that virtual machine.
        - It's not giving efficient!
    - This warranted a change, that came about through Amazon RDS. 
        - RDS saves time, reduces the chance of human error, and provides better resilience performance without the user needing database administration expertise.
        - Side note: **multi-AZ deployment** is a high availability feature in Amazon RDS.
        - This means the primary database is automatically replicated to a standby instance in a different availability zone (AZ) within the same AWS region.
        - Purpose? Safety net. If the primary database fails, RDS automatically fails over to the standby instance, with no data loss and minimal downtime.
    - Another change came in 2012, when Amazon came out with **DynamoDB.**
        - RDS had limitations:
            - horizontal scaling across many servers
            - write throughput (amount of material passing through a system i.e., how fast data can be written)
            - latency increased under load
            - inflexible schema, every change requires table migration
            - global reach required sharding
        - Side note: **sharding** is a database architecture technique where a large dataset is divided into smaller, manageable pieces called "shards" and stored on separate servers.
        - DynamoDB was a solution:
            - NoSQL, schema-less
            - massively scalable
            - ultra-low latency
            - fully managed 
            - elastic
            - built-in high availability 

- 🪄 Real-World Application / Analogy:  
    - EC2 Vs. RDS:
        - EC2: rent a raw kitchen and do everything yourself
        - RDS: order from a chef who delivers ready-made meals so you can just focus on enjoying them (or serving them to users)
    - RDS Vs. DynamoDB:
        - RDS: structured library catalog system
        - DynamoDB: warehouse with labeled bins

## 🧪 Today’s Tools & Experiments  
**Hands-On Playtime**  
- ✅ Explored: Pluralsight Course on Introduction to Amazon Web Services 
- 🔁 What I Did: Watched the course and take notes 
- 🧠 Observation: Tons of vocabulary words I had never heard of... added lots to my internal dictionary today

## 🌀 Concept Checkpoint  
**If I had to explain this to a peer...**  

> Amazon started as an online retailer for books, but it quickly expanded to selling more items.
> In order to cope with expansion, it evolved to build a viable cloud storage system.
> It started with object storage (files, photos, etc) beginning with Amazon S3, Amazon Simple Storage Service.
> Then they created EC2, Elastic Compute Cloud, to allow users to have their own virtual servers (both public and private).
> You could technically host a database using the EC2, but it was annoying for users to manually customize everything.
> Next, they needed a better way to manage the servers, so they made Amazon RDS, Relational Database Service.
> This helped people who didn't want to deal with backend administrative stuff and focus on creation.
> Amazon scaled fast... from selling books to selling everything. 
> They built S3 for storing files, EC2 for compute power, and RDS for easy database management. 
> But for lightning-fast, globally scalable, schema-flexible data access? That’s where DynamoDB came in.
> Summary: Amazon started by selling stuff, built cloud infrastructure to sell more stuff, then opened that infrastructure so others could build and scale their own stuff too — faster, easier, and globally.
