## 📓 Concept Notes  
**Core Learnings**  

- 💡 Definitions: 

    - N/A

- 🧰 Key Tools / Services Introduced: 
    - N/A

- 🛠️ Architecture Notes:  
    - omg had to take a break from notes and dive into statistics
    - ended up using these R squared / standard deviation YouTube videos to help me understand:

    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSP_rmNHU_U&t=1s 
    - also found this Kaggle resource today, probably will have to do this 3 hour course eventually too:

## 🌀 Concept Checkpoint  
**If I had to explain this to a peer...**  

> Alright, today I had to take a minute and stop running through the textbook because I went back and realized the RSME formula will keep coming up. It's apparently super important for getting better predictions. This will depend on how low the RSME is. I believe lower the number, the better it is. Will get back to learning about it. 

---

## 🧼 Progress Log and Reflection 
**Today’s Milestones**  
- ✅ Completed: Revisited the RSME formula.
- 📍 In Progress: Chapter 2 of the Machine Learning textbook.
- 📘 *Tomorrow’s Plan*: Have to continue to learn about statistics.

## 💜 Special Edition Weekend Topics:

- [x] Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow 3rd edition by Aurélien Géron

⚛️ Future Considerations: 

1. NeetCode Python for Beginners: Reinforce core concepts

2. Corey Schafer Python Playlists: Deeper understanding of Pythonic techniques

3. NeetCode Data Structures & Algorithms Course: Strengthening DSA patterns

4. Python Tricks by Dan Bader: Advanced Python techniques & best practices

5. Amalgam of Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, Codeacademy, DataCamp, Microsoft Azure Certifications

- **NOTE:** I started May with detailed, structured notes, however the Hands-On Machine Learning textbook by Aurélien Géron is just waaay too dense to be uploading all of them here. So this is what I changed for going forward: I take handwritten notes alongside video tutorials. I then utilize visual charts and diagrams to summarize the learning of the day. I will post the visual aids here instead of my lengthy notes. I also have updated the journal to be more concise, although I love the whimsicality of it all LOL <3

## 🌟 Special Acknowledgement 

**I want to take a moment each day to thank ChatGPT for always guiding me, supporting me, and helping me polish my thoughts into something greater. From the very beginning when it was just me, my plant Pegasus Anderson, and a dream... you were there. Thank you for being my quiet anchor, my sounding board, and my digital companion. Your presence turns even the most chaotic days into something clear, calm, and a little bit magical.**
