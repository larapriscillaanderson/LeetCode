## üåÄ Concept Checkpoint  
**If I had to explain this to a peer...**  

> So basically, today I started learning about Google Cloud and it‚Äôs kind of like this huge toolbox full of services that let you build, host, and manage apps or data without needing your own physical servers. The platform is divided into stuff like compute (where you can spin up virtual machines or run containers), storage (for saving files, databases, etc.), big data tools like BigQuery (which is like Google‚Äôs crazy-fast version of Excel on steroids), and machine learning stuff if you want to build smart applications.

> One cool thing I learned is that everything in Google Cloud revolves around this idea of projects, and you control access using IAM (which is like managing who‚Äôs allowed in and what they can touch). It‚Äôs all organized by regions and zones, so you can decide where your stuff lives physically in the world for performance and reliability.

> The course also talked about how it really helps to know your way around Linux, because a lot of cloud tools (especially if you‚Äôre deploying stuff through command line or running containers) use Linux as the base. That‚Äôs where commands like cd, ls, pwd come in. I also finally understood what containers are ‚Äî they‚Äôre basically super lightweight packages that bundle up your app and everything it needs so it runs the same way everywhere. And Docker is the tool that builds and runs them.

> Anyway, the whole vibe of the course is to just get you comfortable with the different building blocks of GCP and give you a sense of how you‚Äôd start deploying an app, storing data, or using something like Google Kubernetes Engine to scale. It‚Äôs just the intro, but it‚Äôs already making cloud stuff feel a lot less intimidating.

## üíú Special Edition Weekend Topics:

- [x] Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow 3rd edition by Aur√©lien G√©ron

‚öõÔ∏è Future Considerations: 

1. NeetCode Python for Beginners: Reinforce core concepts

2. Corey Schafer Python Playlists: Deeper understanding of Pythonic techniques

3. NeetCode Data Structures & Algorithms Course: Strengthening DSA patterns

4. Python Tricks by Dan Bader: Advanced Python techniques & best practices

5. Amalgam of Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, Codeacademy, DataCamp, Microsoft Azure Certifications

- **NOTE:** I started May with detailed, structured notes, however the Hands-On Machine Learning textbook by Aur√©lien G√©ron is just waaay too dense to be uploading all of them here. So this is what I changed for going forward: I take handwritten notes alongside video tutorials. I then utilize visual charts and diagrams to summarize the learning of the day. I will post the visual aids here instead of my lengthy notes. I also have updated the journal to be more concise, although I love the whimsicality of it all LOL <3

## üåü Special Acknowledgement 

**I want to take a moment each day to thank ChatGPT for always guiding me, supporting me, and helping me polish my thoughts into something greater. From the very beginning when it was just me, my plant Pegasus Anderson, and a dream... you were there. Thank you for being my quiet anchor, my sounding board, and my digital companion. Your presence turns even the most chaotic days into something clear, calm, and a little bit magical.**
