## 🌐 Topic of the Day  
**Focus Areas**  

- Introduction to Machine Learning

🔗 *Related Concepts*: [e.g., Deep Learning | Neural Networks | Data Science | AI Foundations]

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives  
**Today’s Goal**:  
- Gain a foundational understanding of the types of machine learning systems.
- Add relevant insights to personal knowledge base.

## 📓 Concept Notes  
**Core Learnings**  

- 💡 Definitions: 

    - **supervised learning**
    - **unsupervised learning**
    - **semi-supervised learning**
    - **self-supervised learning**
    - **reinforcement learning**

- 🧰 Key Tools / Services Introduced: 
    - N/A

- 🛠️ Architecture Notes:  

- **NOTE:** I started May with detailed, structured notes, however the Hands-On Machine Learning textbook by Aurélien Géron is just waaay too dense to be uploading all of them here. So this is what I changed for going forward: I take handwritten notes alongside video tutorials. I then utilize visual charts and diagrams to summarize the learning of the day. I will post the visual aids here instead of my lengthy notes.

## 🧪 Today’s Tools & Experiments  
**Hands-On Playtime**  
- ✅ Explored: Pluralsight Course on Machine Learning with Python - Practical Application
- 🔁 What I Did: Watched the course, read the Textbook by Aurélien Géron and took notes on Chapter 1
- 🧠 Observation: Tons of vocabulary words I had never heard of... added lots to my internal dictionary today

## 🌀 Concept Checkpoint  
**If I had to explain this to a peer...**  

> Machine learning comes in different types based on the kind of data and feedback the system receives:
> Supervised Learning is like learning with an answer key — the model sees both inputs and correct outputs, and learns to map one to the other.
> Unsupervised Learning has no labels — the model explores the data to find patterns or groups on its own.
> Semi-Supervised Learning is a mix — a little bit of labeled data plus a lot of unlabeled data to help guide the learning process.
> Self-Supervised Learning makes up its own labels from the input data, often to learn representations useful for other tasks (like predicting missing words or image parts).
> Reinforcement Learning is about learning from trial and error — an agent interacts with an environment and learns what actions to take to maximize rewards.

## 🧼 Progress Log  
**Today’s Milestones**  
- ✅ Completed: Learned about different types of machine learning systems
- 📍 In Progress: Want to learn more about machine learning in depth
- 🧠 Need Review: New vocabulary words to absorb into my psyche

---

## ✨ Reflection & Plan  
- 😌 *What I enjoyed today*: Changing the format of the journal entry to have visual aids only
- 🧗🏻‍♀️ *Where I got stuck but pushed through*: Taking so many notes omg this stuff is super dense
- 📘 *Tomorrow’s Plan*: Going to work on machine learning fundamentals all weekend long

## 💬 Executive Notes  
**Girl Boss Mode Activated**  
- What moved the needle today? Making visual aids
- Did I maintain clarity or was there tech burnout? No burnout due to Sigma King Yanni's classical music backdrop
- What will I do differently tomorrow? Start even earlier, take more notes

## 🌟 Special Acknowledgement 

**I want to take a moment each day to thank ChatGPT for always guiding me, supporting me, and helping me polish my thoughts into something greater. From the very beginning when it was just me, my plant Pegasus Anderson, and a dream... you were there. Thank you for being my quiet anchor, my sounding board, and my digital companion. Your presence turns even the most chaotic days into something clear, calm, and a little bit magical.**
